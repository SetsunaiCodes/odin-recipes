<h1>The steps:</h1>
    <p>So now that you're aware of all the ingredients you need, you can start with the fun part! The actual preparation</p>
<ol>
    <li>First of all the dough - Mix the flour and salt and slowly add the water that has just been boiled. Simply use two chopsticks to mix and when the dough is well mixed, switch to "kneading with your hands". Then it is no longer a problem with the initially hot water. A clean and uncomplicated affair through the chopsticks. The dough should then really be kneaded for several minutes, then it becomes really soft and smooth.</li>
    <li>Finally, form the dough into two equal-sized balls. Then take the first. Shape these into a long, uniform strand and fold them into a donut ring. Press the ends together. Do the same with the second ball of dough. Now the rings next to each other on a board, cover and leave to rest.
    </li>Finely dice the zucchini, carrot, ginger and garlic. (Chinese cabbage and spring onions also go very well, then chop them very small.) Add everything to the mince.</li>
    <li>Since I cook a lot by eye, the information has to be adjusted in each case. The vegetable mince mass should have a good consistency and hold together. I would tend to 1/3 vegetables and 2/3 minced meat for this to be the case. If available, add a small dash of sesame oil and a dash of soy sauce. It doesn't need more seasoning. Mix everything well and set aside.</li>    
    <li>Now divide the first ring of dough in the middle with a knife and lay the two straight strands parallel in front of you. Divide these again in the middle and lay them parallel to each other again so that you have four pieces of dough in front of you. Now divide them three times evenly spaced. Exactly 16 pieces of dough of the same size come out.</li>
    <li>Press each piece of dough flat with your hand and put aside with a little flour, so it is already somewhat pre-formed. Do the same with the second ring of dough and you have 32 round, equally sized pieces of dough in front of you that can be worked on. You should always have some flour nearby and sprinkle the countertop as needed.</li>
    <li>Using a rolling pin, roll out each sheet of dough into a flat circle. The finished circles of dough should be very thin and even. They can be floured and stacked on top of each other or you can finish each dumpling right away.</li>
    <li>Place each circle of dough in your slightly cupped hand to create a small indentation. Now take some of the filling out of the bowl (it's best to use a normal breakfast knife) and put it in the middle. Then you use your thumb to help and pretend to fold the dumpling together, but leave a gap and do not press the dough together yet. Then press the dough together like a fan from right to left (or vice versa for left-handers). The side away from you fans out piece by piece over the side facing you, which remains smooth. This creates this practical form of non-falling dumpling. It is best to collect all the dumplings on a floured plate, if possible without touching each other.</li>
    <li>Now the recipe is about the pot sticker version. This means that the jiaozi are fried before cooking. When roasting, you have to work in two passes because of the amount.</li>
    <li>Heat a small amount of oil, if possible sesame oil, in a pan. Line up the first 16 dumplings and let them brown underneath. When a good degree of browning is achieved after a few minutes, add 100 ml of water, put a lid on the pan and turn the heat down to low. The dumplings will cook in minutes.</li>
    <li>In the meantime, put the dip ingredients in a small bowl (the dimensions are not exact, everything is free to use by feel). You can also add some spring onions or toasted sesame seeds.    </li>
    <li>And then you're good to go! Enjoy your dish!</li>
